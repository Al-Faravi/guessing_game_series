# Number Guessing Game 
 
This is a Number Guessing Game built with Python's Tkinter. The player tries to guess a secret number within a limited number of tries, based on the chosen difficulty level (Easy, Medium, Hard). 
 
## How it works: 
- The game picks a random secret number within a range defined by the difficulty level. 
- The player inputs guesses, and the game gives feedback: "Too low," "Too high," or "Correct." 
- The number of tries is tracked, and the game ends when the player guesses correctly or runs out of tries. 
- The player's name and game results are saved in a history file, which can be viewed anytime. 
- The UI includes input validation, level selection, dynamic feedback, and buttons to reset or view history. 
 
This project demonstrates basic game logic, user input handling, and file storage, all wrapped in a clean and interactive GUI.
